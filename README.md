# What
    
    Welcome to the webpage of our chatbot!

      
 ## Our chatbot is very intelligent and can talk to you in the following structure:

1. On loading of the page, the bot welcomes the user with a random greeting message (our bot has at least three different welcoming messages).
    
2. Then, our chatbot asks the user "how do you feel today?".

3. The user can reply freely, and the bot will check in the response if he can find a "yes" or a "no": 

        if the script find a "yes" in the message, the bot answers with a random sentence from a specific set (minimum three different)
        if the script find a "no" in the message, the bot answers with a random sentence from a specific set (minimum three different)
        if the script cannot find a "yes" or a "no" in the message, the bot answer something like "I didn't understand, can you please try again"
        if the script cannot find a "yes" or a "no" in the message after three attempts, our bot begins to be mad and use "passive-agressive" answers, like "dude, are you sure you can read?" 


4. After this answer, our bot will finish his routine. He says "bye" to the user and the textarea go to disabled mode.Advantages of Chatbots

# How


1. first, we needed an UI, which was just a list of messages (there's two types of messages - those from the bots and those from the user) and a text area with a send button.

2. Sending a message to the bot has been done by clicking the send button or typing ENTER.
