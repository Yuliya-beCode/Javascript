# When  

The first self-learning bot was created by Microsoft, which tweeted the self-learning chat Tay in 2016.

Today chatbots are often used in business to advise and provide information to clients. For these purposes, chatbots are most often used in social networks or applications.

Our project has been started on 15/02/2021 and completed on 17/02/2021.



# How


 ## Our chatbot is very intelligent and can talk to you in the following structure:

1. On loading of the page, the bot welcomes the user with a random greeting message (our bot has 5 different welcoming messages).
    
2. Then, our chatbot asks the user "How are you doing? Would you like to talk to me?".

3. The user can reply freely, and the bot will check in the response if he can find a "yes" or a "no": 

        if the script find a "yes" in the message, the bot answers with a random sentence from a specific set 
        if the script find a "no" in the message, the bot answers with a random sentence from a specific set 
        if the script cannot find a "yes" or a "no" in the message, the bot answers something like "I didn't understand, can you please try again"
        if the script cannot find a "yes" or a "no" in the message after three attempts, our bot begins to be mad and use "passive-agressive" answer "Are you serious that you don't know how to read questions carefully. I do not want to talk to you anymore. You know where you can find me. Bye!" 
        if our bot receives an empty message, he will answer in the following way "I receive an empty message. Please try again."

According to the mood of our bot, a smurf image will be also changed

4. After this answer, our bot will finish his routine. He says "bye" to the user and the textarea goes to disabled mode.


Sending a message to the bot has been done by clicking the send button and also by pressing ENTER.

Our bot also suppotrs multi-line messages: by typing SHIFT+ENTER, you can create a new line in the textarea.
